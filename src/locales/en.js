  faq_5_item_3_text: "Here are just a few reasons why we believe that gradual weight loss is a far better choice for you - although we can go on about this for hours:<br><br>Creating the right habits: Your mind and body have the time to adjust to new patterns and create habits.<br><br>So even after your meal plan ends, you won‚Äôt slip back into the old ways.<br><br>Improving your health: Unlike fast diets, gradual changes won‚Äôt put your body under stress and disturb its metabolic processes.<br><br>Getting sustainable results: With the new habits and without disturbing your body, you‚Äôll avoid the ‚Äúyo-yo effect‚Äù and keep your hard-earned results.<br><br>Enjoying the process: Feeling tired and getting cravings is no fun!<br><br>But with gradual weight loss, your calorie deficit is just right for you to make progress without experiencing any downsides.<br><br>Remember that it‚Äôs not just about losing weight.<br><br>With Calori, you can transition towards a healthier life, make the right habits, enjoy delicious meals, and save time for things you love üíö",

  faq_5_item_7_text: "The check-ins only take less than 5 minutes of your time once every week.<br><br>Here‚Äôs how they work in 4 short steps:<br><br>1. Get a reminder one day before the check-in as an SMS text or an email.<br><br>2. Weigh yourself on the morning of the check-in.<br><br>3. Log into your account and input your latest weight.<br><br>4.
